    <p>Hi again,</p>

    <p>So, this is the part where I tell you that I am passionate about creating seamless, accessible, and user-centred experiences that meet business goals. I knowww, these are just fluffy words, and you've heard all these before. However, beyond the fluff, my case studies are here to show you that I know my stuff. </p>
        
    <p>While I am interested in all the stages of building products, UX Research is where I truly thrive and I am grateful for a career that pays me to solve problems. </p>
        
    <p>Now that we're done with that, here are some non-fluffy things you can know about me - I have a background in laboratory research and investigation. I love a good puzzle. I really like bread (of any kind). Other than design, I also really like to read good books, have conversations with the community living inside my head, and watch true crime documentaries that keep me up at night. </p>
        
    <p>But enough about me. Now, I'd like to meet you. </p>
