<h1>Chingoo - Gift exchange platform</h1>

<p>Chingoo is a gift-sharing application that was inspired by the shutdown of reddit gifts. It aims to create a community where it's members can successfully plan and execute private and public anonymous gift exchange events.</p>

<h3>PROJECT DETAILS</h3>
  <p>Role: Sole UX Researcher and Designer</p>
  <p>Methods: Surveys, Semi-structured Interviews, Competitive analysis, Empathy mapping, IA.</p>
  <p>Duration: 6 weeks.</p>
  <p>Tools: Figma, Miro.</p>
  <p>Project Type: Client Project. (Responsive Website & Web Application).</p>

<h3>PROJECT OVERVIEW</h3>
  <p>Gift-exchanges on the internet with strangers, as weird as it may sound, is not a new idea. In fact, it was the retirement of one of the major players in the game, Reddit gifts, that birthed the idea for Chingoo. When their favourite gift-exchange platform was officially shutting down, my clients had the idea to not just start their own, but to take it up a notch. They wanted to create a platform not just for strangers but also for family members, friends, companies, and basically anybody that wanted to plan a secret gift-exchange. This was the primary aim for the platform. The secondary aim, which was what inspired the name Chingoo (the Korean word for friend), was to also create a community where virtual strangers could maybe form lifelong friendships by virtue of their shared interest and participation in these events.</p>
  <p>To kick-off this project, I conducted stakeholder interviews, user interviews, and secondary research to properly understand the problem space and the pain points of the users. Insights gotten from these formed the basis of the ideation, wireframing, and design that came after. 6 weeks later, Chingoo was headed for development.</p>

<h3>Project Summary</h3>
  <p>A more detailed explanation of my design process is provided after this section. This section is to provide you with a brief 5 minute summary of the users needs that were uncovered during research, the business goals, and some key features in the final solution.  Just in case you don't have the time to read it all.</p>


<h3>GOALS & OBJECTIVES</h3>
<h4>Business Goals</h4>
<ul>
  <li>To provide a secure and seamless application.</li>
  <li>To provide a solution that inspires happiness in the users.</li>
  <li>To create a community of friends through the events on the platform.</li>
</ul>

<h4>User Needs</h4>
<ul>
  <li>An easier way to know which gifts to get for their partners during gift exchanges.</li>
  <li>A more efficient way of anonymously dropping off these gifts after buying them.</li>
  <li>Assurance that their partners were not going to runoff without completing the gift exchange.</li>
</ul>

<p>After concluding the stakeholder and user research, I was able to put together the problem statement for the project.</p>

<h3>PROBLEM STATEMENT</h3>
<p>People perform gift-exchange events but struggle with the security of the various platforms, knowing the right gifts to get for their partners, and how to drop these gifts off.</p>

<h3>PROJECT LIMITATIONS & CONSTRAINTS.</h3>
<p>During this project, I would have loved to conduct much more research, and perform usability tests at the end of the project. But limited finances and lack of sufficient time prevented that.</p>

<h3>KEY FEATURES</h3>
<p>Some of the key features of the final solution along with the user need or business goals they met are described below:</p>

<h3>PROJECT DETAILS</h3>
<p>An in-depth look into all the processes that went into the research & conceptualization of the final design.</p>

<h3>STAKEHOLDER INTERVIEWS</h3>
<p>To begin the project, I conducted stakeholder interviews to understand the business goals, and understand what they already knew about their target market. After this I conducted secondary research to have a better understanding of the problem domain. I then sent out screener surveys to find eligible participants for semi-structured interviews.  I then conducted the interviews with the eligible participants.</p>


<h4>Research Objectives.</h4>
<ul>
  <li> To find out what type of gift exchanges they had previously participated in.</li>
  <li>To find out the challenges they faced during those exchanges</li>
  <li>To find out how they tried to solve these challenges</li>
</ul>

<h3>RESEARCH INSIGHTS</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The business wanted to provide a secure and seamless application.</li>
  <li>The business wanted to provide a solution that inspires happiness in the users.</li>
  <li>The business wanted to create a community of friends through the events on the platform.</li>
  <li>The users wanted an easier way to know which gifts to get for their partners during gift exchanges.</li>
  <li>The users wanted a more efficient way of anonymously dropping off these gifts after buying them.</li>
  <li>The users wanted assurance that their partners were not going to runoff without completing the gift exchange.</li>
</ul>

<h3>COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS</h3>
<p>I also conducted competitive analysis on some businesses that were offering similar servicces. The aim of this analysis was to understand what made them unique, how their target users compared with the target users of the solution I was building, and what things they were doing really well or really badly. The findings from the analysis are shown below.</p>

<h3>REMAINING USER CENTERED</h3>
<p>The insights gathered during the research were used to develop a user persona and an empathy map. The aim of this was to transform our users from fictional characters in our heads to real life people with real life problems, that could encourage empathy.</p>

<h3>PRODUCT ROADMAP</h3>
<p>After creating the empathy map and user persona, I had a meeting with the project stakeholders to present them. Based on the insights gotten, we had a brainstorming session to create a product roadmap. The roadmap is blurred due to confidentiality.</p>

<h3>INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE</h3>
<p>After the product roadmap had been created, I drew up the information architecture to visualize the layout of the application. The aim of this was to make the application as easy as possible for users to navigate. Due to confidentiality, I can only display the high level IA.</p>

<h3>THE SOLUTION</h3>
<p>After the information architecture had been defined, I made sketches on paper to sort through the ideas in my head.  I then created a style guide on Figma, and the high fidelity designs.</p>

<h3>NEXT STEPS</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Usability Tests. Due to time and budget, I was not able to conduct usability tests before the project was handed off for development. As a next step. I would like to conduct some usability tests.</li>
  <li>More Research. During the wireframing stage, I realized that there was a key user group that we did not account for during the research. Unfortunately, due to time constraints I was not able to go back and speak to those users, and we moved on with the MVP. I would like to correct that as quickly as possible.</li>
</ul>

<h3>LESSONS LEARNT</h3>
<p>The most important thing  I learnt during this project was stakeholder management. This project had multiple stakeholders, so to ensure that everyone was on the same page, I had to be in constant communication with all of them.</p>
